# Data-Encryption-Standard

## Project Overview

The Data-Encryption-Standard project implements the DES encryption algorithm, which was widely used from the early 1970s to 1999. This algorithm can encrypt a 64-bit string. The project was undertaken as a passion project, translating mathematical instructions from a renowned professor in Berlin into code. The original article detailing these instructions can be found [here](http://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~kant/teaching/hess/krypto-ws2006/des.htm).
